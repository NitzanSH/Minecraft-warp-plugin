# Minecraft-warp-plugin
A small warp plugin for minecraft, could be useful for some.

Added permission support.

Adds a few commands which are:
/setwarp <name>  Which basically sets warps at the current player location.
/tpwarp <name> TPs the player who used the command to the warp.
/warps Which shows you all of the available warps.
/delwarp <name> deletes a warp.
Also you can get a sign and type at the first line Warp between two brackets as shown here: http://prntscr.com/bpgs37 . You can also type warp or WARP between 2 brackets and it will change it automatically, on some other line type the warp name as shown above, then right click the sign and it will tp you to the written warp.

-PERMISSIONS WILL BE ADDED SOON, ATM EVERYONE CAN SET AND DELETE WARPS. WILL BE FIXED.
