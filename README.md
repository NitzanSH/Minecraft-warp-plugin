# Minecraft-warp-plugin
A small warp plugin for minecraft, could be useful for some.

Adds a few commands which are:
/setwarp <name>  Which basically sets warps at the current player location.
/tpwarp <name> TPs the player who used the command to the warp.
/warps Which shows you all of the available warps.
/delwarp <name> delets a warp.
Also you can get a sign and type at the first line [Warp] (or [warp] or [WARP] it doesnt matter) and on one of the other lines the warp name, then right click the sign and it will tp you to the written warp.

PERMISSIONS WILL BE ADDED SOON, ATM EVERYONE CAN SET AND DELETE WARPS. WILL BE FIXED.
